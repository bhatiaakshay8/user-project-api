# user-project-api
User Project Api Service

### Assumptions taken
1. Not Encoding Passwords as part of this assignment. But redacted from response and removed from logs.
2. Email is Unique 
3. Deleting a user currently will delete itâ€™s external projects too. Can be implemented other way round by throwing an error. 
4. Have applied uniqueness to project name too. Same project name cannot be added again to a user.
5. Update user will update name and password only. Not updating email for now. 

### Module structure
- `user-project-api-service.main.docker` - Docker File, env file for docker compose and prometheus config are defined here
- `user-project-api-service.main.java` - application entry point application context, rest controllers are defined here
- `user-project-api-service.main.resources` - Spring boot application properties config and Liquibase DB changelogs are defined here
- `mssql` - Containerised MS SQL instance
- `htmlReport` - contains test coverage report. Have 90% class coverage, 80% method and line coverage.
- `root project` - Root build.gradle, docker compose and deploy all script are defined here


### Build and Deploy

- Run `./scripts/deploy-all.sh` from root folder of this repo. It will deploy mssql instance, user-project-api-service. Metrics has been configured and exposed from spring boot app and the script will also deploy prometheus and grafana container for metrics scraping and visualisation.

  `localhost:${PORT}` PORT (currently 8080) is defined in `user-project-api-service/src/main/docker/env.list`
  Swagger Documentation which can be used to test the api at:
  `http://localhost:${PORT}/swagger-ui/index.html`

- You can access prometheus dashboard on - localhost:9090.

- You can access grafana dashboard on - localhost:3000.

Authentication also implemented with initial user creds in db migration `user-project-api-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/data/insert_admin_user.sql`:

`username`: admin@example.com
`password`: password123

### Stop the docker stack

run `docker compose stop` from root folder of this repo or `./scripts/stop-all.sh`

### Run Tests
